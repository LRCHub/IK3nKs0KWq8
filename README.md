[00:04.78] Baby, join me in death
[00:13.45] Baby, join me in death
[00:22.04] Baby, join me in death
[00:33.04] 
[00:30.10] We are so young
[00:32.80] Our lives have just begun
[00:37.23] But already we are considering
[00:41.88] To escape from this world
[00:54.38] 
[00:45.75] And we've waited, too, for so long
[00:50.32] For this moment to come
[00:54.01] We're so anxious to be together
[00:58.22] Together in death, whoa, whoa
[01:12.72] 
[01:04.29] Won't you die tonight for love? (Baby, join me in death)
[01:12.67] Won't you die? (Baby, join me in death)
[01:21.06] Won't you die tonight for love? (Baby, join me in death)
[01:49.06] 
[01:33.24] This world is a cruel place
[01:36.31] And we're here only to lose
[01:40.45] So before life tears us apart let
[01:44.50] Death bless me with you, whoa, whoa
[02:02.00] 
[01:50.78] Won't you die tonight for love? (Baby, join me in death)
[01:58.86] Will you die? (Baby, join me in death)
[02:07.68] Won't you die tonight for love? (Baby, join me in death)
[02:16.74] Join me in death (ah, ooh), whoa, whoa, ho
[02:37.74] 
[02:28.08] This life ain't worth living
[02:36.52] This life, it ain't worth living
[02:41.05] (Join me, join me)
[02:45.26] This life ain't worth living (join me, join me)
[02:49.71] (Join me, join me)
[02:53.25] This life ain't worth living
[03:07.25] 
[02:58.05] Won't you die tonight for love? (Baby, join me in death)
[03:06.43] So, would you die? (Baby, join me in death)
[03:15.08] Won't you die tonight for love? (Baby, join me in death)
[03:43.08] 
[03:23.44] Baby, join me in death, ah
